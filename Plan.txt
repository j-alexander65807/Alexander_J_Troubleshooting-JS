Bugs
1) Limit drop zones to one puzzle-piece (each puzzle-piece becomes a child of the dropzone in DOM, so if we check for children maybe we can deny the drop using return)
2) Reset needs to refresh the game board (is removeChild the best option or could we call 
the same function that originally sets the the page up or is there other methods)
